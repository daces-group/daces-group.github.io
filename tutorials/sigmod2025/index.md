## Abstract

Data markets play a pivotal role in modern industries by facilitating the exchange of data for predictive
modeling, targeted marketing, and research. However, as data becomes a valuable commodity, privacy and
security concerns have grown, particularly regarding the personal information of individuals. This tutorial
explores privacy and security issues when integrating different data sources in data market platforms.
As motivation for the importance of enforcing privacy requirements, we discuss attacks on data markets
focusing on membership inference and reconstruction attacks. We also discuss security vulnerabilities in
decentralized data marketplaces, including adversarial manipulations by buyers or sellers. We provide an
overview of privacy and security mechanisms designed to mitigate these risks. In order to enforce the
least amount of trust for buyers and sellers, we focus on distributed protocols. Finally, we conclude with
opportunities for future research on understanding and mitigating privacy and security concerns in distributed
data markets.

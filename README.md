## Overview

The **DACES** (**D**ata structures and **A**lgorithms for **C**ommunications **E**ngineering **S**afety) is a research group at the [The Grainger College of Engineering](https://grainger.illinois.edu/) at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. We study data structures and algorithms for ensuring the trust, reliability, and security of *modern* communications infrastructure. Through the lens of the theory of *information, computation, and complexity*, we aim to design and analyze algorithms for trustworthy systems with provable guarantees. Whenever possible, we liaise with experts on socio-politics and economics to further understand the consequences of our technical work.

## Topics

Here are some subject areas we devote our attention to:
* Creating and Auditing Trustworthy Statistics and Machine Learning:
    * Attack Models for Data Privacy, Security, Robustness
    * Solution Models for Data Privacy, Security, Robustness
* Representation, Learning, and Verification of Structured Data and Outcomes:
    * Graph Embeddings and Relational Graph Learning
    * Verification of Computational Science (including Materials Science)
    * Safety of Quantum Information

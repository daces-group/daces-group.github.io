## Overview

The **DACES** (**D**ata structures and **A**lgorithms for **C**ommunications **E**ngineering **S**afety) is a research group devoted to the study of data structures, algorithms, and information theory for ensuring the trust, reliability, and security of communications infrastructure. We aim to design and analyze algorithms for trustworthy systems with provable guarantees on communication cost, privacy levels, memory usage, and computational and statistical efficiency. To this end, we use a variety of mathematical and computational tools to advance the state-of-the-art. Whenever possible, we liaise with experts on socio-politics and economics to further understand the consequences of our technical work.
